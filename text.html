        <p>As patterns emerged, and as Andrew mentioned them to his co-workers, people started borrowing his "field guide." His detailed notes helped them avoid pitfalls and saved a lot of time. As Andrew's notes grew, so did the number of people who wanted them.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>What started as his own journal soon became the Field Guide to the Distributed Development Stack, an ongoing collaborative project. This report is a snapshot of what the Field Guide includes to date, but the guide and the framework are meant to be a living resource. So, we put the source on GitHub and invite you to contribute. If you feel the Guide is missing a tool or a major theme, then fork the repo and send along a pull request.</p></li>
    
            <li>
                <p>You'll find contribution details inside the report, along with a framework full of useful tools and ideas.When you explore a new technology landscape, the journey can take you to places you never expected. Take O'Reilly's CTO, Andrew Odewahn. While working on ideas for a new publishing platform, Andrew kept notes as he probed the depth and breadth of what we call the "distributed development stack" (DDS).
